;;; Commentary:

;; THIS PACKAGE IS MERELY A TEMPLATE AND UNFIT FOR DIRECT USE.  See
;; below for a list of modifications needed to make this package your
;; own.  DO NOT try to use this package directly.

;;  A basic template mode to create an â€˜org-superstarâ€™-experience for
;;  modes other than Org.

;; Here are some Unicode blocks which are generally nifty resources
;; for this package:
;;
;; General Punctuation (U+2000-U+206F): Bullets, leaders, asterisms.
;; Dingbats (U+2700-U+27BF)
;; Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows (U+2B00-U+2BFF):
;;     Further stars and arrowheads.
;; Miscellaneous Symbols (U+2600â€“U+26FF): Smileys and card suits.
;; Supplemental Arrows-C (U+1F800-U+1F8FF)
;; Geometric Shapes (U+25A0-U+25FF): Circles, shapes within shapes.
;; Geometric Shapes Extended (U+1F780-U+1F7FF):
;;     More of the above, and stars.
;;

;;; TO DO:

;; Here are the minimum necessary steps to make this package useful to
;; others (and yourself).  The text below is formatted as an Org
;; checklist for your convenience, and coincides with the file
;; CHECKLIST.org.

;;; Code:

  "List of bullets used in MODE headings.
It can contain any number of bullets, the Nth entry usually
corresponding to the bullet used for level N.  The way this list
is cycled through can be fine-tuned by customizing
â€˜superstar-kit-cycle-headline-bulletsâ€™.

Every entry in this list can either be a character or a cons
cell.  Characters are used as simple, verbatim replacements of
the headline character for every display (be it graphical or
terminal).  If the list element is a cons cell, it should be a
proper list of the form
\(COMPOSE-STRING CHARACTER)

where COMPOSE-STRING should be a string according to the rules of
the third argument of â€˜compose-regionâ€™.  It will be used to
compose the specific headline bullet.  CHARACTER is the fallback
character used in terminal displays, where composing characters
cannot be relied upon.

You should re-enable KITM after changing this variable
for your changes to take effect."
